<!-- NOTE:
The login form HTML and styling are implemented inside header.php 
to make the login modal accessible on all pages throughout the site.

This approach allows users to open the login modal from anywhere without
loading a separate login page, improving user experience.

The backend login processing logic (authentication, session handling, etc.)
can be handled in this file or another script. -->
